            <p class="lead">The guitar is a fretted stringed instrument that dates back to the 16th century in Spain.
              The
              lute, the guitar's forefather, was widely employed in mediaeval Europe, but the guitar's shape allowed for
              more versatility and appeal.The popularity of the guitar grew throughout Europe before being carried to
              the
              Americas by Spanish conquistadors. The guitar became an iconic instrument in popular music during the
              twentieth century, notably in genres such as blues, rock, and country.The guitar is still frequently used
              today. Its versatility has made it a standard in
              practically every genre of music, and it remains a favourite instrument with performers and music
              enthusiasts alike</p>

              <p class="lead">The piano is a musical instrument invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori in Italy in the early
                18th century. When compared to predecessors such as the harpsichord, the piano's architecture allowed
                for a greater variety of dynamics and expression. The piano quickly became popular in Europe and spread
                to other parts of the world. It quickly became a fixture in concert halls, drawing rooms, and music
                schools, and its versatility made it a favourite of composers and performers of all genres. The piano
                evolved further in the twentieth century with the development of electric and electronic models, but the
                traditional acoustic piano remains the most popular type of piano today. </p>

              <p class="lead">Drums are among the oldest musical instruments, going back to ancient civilizations in
                Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Throughout history, drums have been utilised for communication,
                religious rites, and entertainment.
                Drums were first utilised in symphonic music in the 18th century in Western music, but their popularity
                skyrocketed in the 20th century with the rise of jazz, rock, and other popular genres. Drum kits, which
                comprise several types of drums and cymbals, have become an essential part of current popular music, and
                drumming styles and techniques continue to change and influence new generations of performers.
                Drums are still an important part of many musical genres today, and drummers are admired for their
                talent and innovation.
